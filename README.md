# Frontend Practice

This repository contains small frontend exercises that I practice while learning HTML and CSS.

The goal is to build a solid foundation before moving to JavaScript and frontend frameworks.

## Demo
Open `index.html` at the root to navigate and preview all UI exercises.

## Exercises
- Card UI: basic card layout using HTML and CSS
- Card with Badge: overlay badge using position (relative / absolute)

## What I focus on
- Clean HTML structure
- CSS box model and layout fundamentals
- Responsive design without flex or grid (at beginner level)
- Small, meaningful commits

## Future plan
- Learn Flexbox and Grid
- Add JavaScript for interactivity
- Refactor UI using modern layout techniques

This repo is part of my frontend learning journey.
