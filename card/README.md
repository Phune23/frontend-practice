# Card UI

This exercise focuses on building a basic card UI using only HTML and CSS.

## What I practiced
- HTML semantic structure
- CSS box model (margin, padding, border)
- Inline-block layout
- Basic responsive design with media queries

## Notes
- Avoid using `float` for main layout
- Focus on spacing, alignment, and readability
- Responsive layout switches from horizontal to vertical on small screens
